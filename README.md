# SemanticApp
I used Android-Studio to develop this app.
If you want to run the app, clone the git and import the project into 
your Android Studio.
Now you can build the app.

If you only want to test the app, you can download the app-release.apk 
file from the app folder and install it on your device.
The app needs permission for your Network and the local storage.
If the map isn't loading, enable the network permission.
